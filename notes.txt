Customer wants to schedule the VM snapshot task as per thier need.
They do not have playbook or report license.
This can be achieved by scripting. 
Using v3 APIs, we cannot take snapshot, but VM recovery point can be take_snapshots
PC does not allow to take VM recovery point of multiple vms
Issue is : we cannot make recovery points for the VMs that are protected by some Protection Domain by PE.
But we can take snapshot from PE even if Vm is protected by a PD!
The current code works well for Vms not protectd by a PD and it captures vm recovery point
now getting PE creds and use v2 / v1 apis to complete this task, its a better option!

fetching vms from PE rather than PC. 





use a common service account same for all pes and PC

































LOL : by v2 api, we can take snapshot of fsvm, pcvm too !!


thank god, we cannot take snapshot of cvm by any api
